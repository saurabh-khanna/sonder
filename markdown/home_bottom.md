This is the world's knowledge.

and this is you.

surrounded by humans tending to think like you.

accessing this knowledge through algorithms<sup>2</sup> trained to optimize what you ~~need~~ consume &#8594; surprise surprise, more of the same.

making you consider this as the world's knowledge.

which in fact, is your _knowledge bubble_.

a bubble robbing you of the _choice_ to understand those who know, think, and grow differently.

Sonder is an attempt to make this _choice_ explicit.

Knowledge bubbles can be hard to break, but not as hard to be conscious of. Guided by this vision, we have three projects under development:

  - `polar` shows how the same knowledge appears to those from
    diametrically opposite knowledge bubbles
  - `spectrum` shows how access to knowledge varies with variation in
    its polarity and subjectivity
  - `balance` searches the internet for you - maintaining a balance
    between knowledge relevance and knowledge diversity (under
    development)
