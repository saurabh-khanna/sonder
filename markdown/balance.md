Our access to knowledge carries biases inherent in algorithms _trained_ to maximize ~~understanding~~ consumption. This robs us of the _choice_ to understand those who learn, think, and grow differently. `Sonder` is an attempt to make this choice explicit. To at least be conscious of our knowledge bubbles, if not break them.
