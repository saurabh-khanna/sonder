>> the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own—populated with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries and inherited craziness—an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground, with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you’ll never know existed, in which you might appear only once, as an extra sipping coffee in the background, as a blur of traffic passing on the highway, as a lighted window at dusk.

Our access to knowledge carries biases inherent in algorithms _trained_ to ~~promote understanding~~ maximize consumption. This robs us of the _choice_ to understand those who learn, think, and grow differently. `Sonder` is an attempt to make this choice explicit. To at least be conscious of our knowledge bubbles, if not break them.

We are working on two projects:
+ `Bias`: An attempt to understand how fair our search for web knowledge is.
+ `Balance`: An attempt to enable fairer knowledge access. Affirmative action for knowledge search per se.
